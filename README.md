# Let's take a Rain Check - Literally

Peacock helps us to know if it rains in sometime. Unfortunately I dont have one. What if I want to know if it rains tomorrow??? maybe in Australia ?? This is 'RainMan' reporting from Dallas, Texas. But we'll talk about the weather in the "land down under".  

Caution - Take your umbrellas it may rain!

P.S. - The project forecasts weather in Australia. It deals with several classification models to predict rain. Since the data is imbalanced sampling models is used to reduce the misclassification caused by it.
